# ros_copter

This is intended to eventually be a fully-featured multirotor autopilot for ROS.  It will be built according to the method published in LINK, so as to allow anyone to easily understand, modify and use the code.

The package is intended to be used with fcu\_io or fcu\_sim, for hardware or simulation, respectively.

It is a single ROS package, with several nodes.
